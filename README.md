## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This project is for educational purposes and for learning new tools, it was first carried out in full javascript in the frontend with the help of typeorm and node js for the backend.
It's a simple kanban. Recently, I switched the backend with AdonisJS and the frontend with React/Next in typescript.
